        <h1 id="ARPNET">ARPANET</h1>
        <h3>What is Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)?</h3>
        <p>It was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to
            implement the TCP/IP protocol suite.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET " target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
        <p>In 1966, Bob Tylor launched the ARPANET project to allow distant computers to share resources</p>
        <p>The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of
            Defense
            1969.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET " target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
        <p>The goal of ARPA was to finance cutting-edge research. Rather than being designed with users in mind, the ARPANET was
            a
            communications-oriented research initiative. However, the Defence Communications Agency took over the operational
            administration of the ARPANET in the summer of 1975.The first ARPANET encryption devices were put into service to
            support secret traffic about this time.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET " target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
        <p>The technological advancements and practical applications achieved through the ARPANET were instrumental in shaping
            modern computer networking including the internet. Development and implementation of the concepts of packet
            switching,
            decentralized communication, and the development of protocols like TCP/IP laid the foundation for a global network
            that
            revolutionized communication, information sharing and collaborative research across the world.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET " target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
        <p>Several institutions received funding from the NSF in 1985 to construct national supercomputing centers, and in 1986,
            the NSFNET initiative offered network connectivity and access. Universities and government organizationsstarted
            using
            NSFNET as their Internet backbone.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET " target="_blank">[1]</a></p>
        <p>In 1990, the ARPANET project was formally discontinued. As the ARPANET was shut down following the advent of the
            NSFNet,
            the initial IMPs and TIPs were phased away, however, some IMPs were still in use as late as July 1990.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET " target="_blank">[1]</a></p>

        <h1 id="internet">The Internet</h1>
        <h3>What is the internet?</h3>
        <p>The Internet is a global network of computers connected to each other which communicate through a standardized set of
            protocols.<a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/what-is-internet" target="_blank">[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>The United States Department of Defense created the Internet in the late 1960s to create a decentralised communication
        network that would be resistant to a nuclear attack. However, billions of people use the internet today to obtain
        information, contact with friends and family, conduct business, and much more. It is become a necessary component of
        modern life. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank">[3]</a></p>
        <h3>How the internet Work?</h3>
        <p>At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized
            protocols. These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted
            reliably and securely.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a>
        </p>
        <p>The global network of linked routers that makes up the internet's core is in charge of guiding traffic between various
            systems and devices. Data is delivered from your device to a router via tiny packets when it is sent over the internet.
            After reviewing the packet, the router sends it on to the following router along the route to its destination. This
            procedure keeps going until the packet gets to its intended location.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a>
        </p>
        <p>The internet uses a number of protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP),
        to guarantee that packets are sent and received correctly. TCP makes sure that packets are transmitted consistently and
        in the right order, whereas IP handles packet routing to the appropriate location.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Concepts and Terminology</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Packet: A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
            <li>Router: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
            <li>IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct
                destination.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
            <li>Domain Name: A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as google.com.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
            <li>DNS: The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
            <li>HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a
                server
                (such as a website).<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
            <li>HTTPS: An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.
            <a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
            <li>SSL/TLS: The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure
                communication over
                the internet.<a href="https://cs.fyi/guide/how-does-internet-work" target="_blank">[4]</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="WWW">WWW</h1>
        <h3>What is the World Wide Web?</h3>
        <p>is a group of websites or web pages that are linked to local computers over the internet and kept on web servers. These
        websites have text sections, digital photos, audio files, movies, and more. Users can use their computers, laptops, cell
        phones, and other internet-connected devices to access the content of these sites from anywhere in the world. Text and
        media can be retrieved and displayed on your device via the internet and WWW.<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-world-wide-web" target="_blank">[5]</a>
        </p>
        <p>The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called "hypertext" or
            hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP. These links are electronic connections that link related pieces of information so
            that
            users can access the desired information quickly. Hypertext offers the advantage to select a word or phrase from
            text
            and thus to access other pages that provide additional information related to that word or phrase.<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-world-wide-web" target="_blank">[5]</a>

        <h1 id="Web_Client">Web Client</h1>
        <h3>What is Web Client(Browser)?</h3>
            <p>A web client is a client-side application used for connecting to a web server over HTTP. It is typically a Web
                browseror web app which displays web pages received from the server and allows users to interact with the web server.<a href="https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/what-is-a-web-client-and-how-it-works-with-web-server-applications/" target="_blank">[6]</a>

        <hr>
        <h1 id="Web_Server">Web Server</h1>
        <h3>What is Web Server?</h3>
        <p>Web Servers are systems that are connected to the internet and store web pages. In addition it sends out requested
            data
            over the web using HTTP. In nutshell, like Apache– the Web Servers are just like libraries for web pages. They
            store,
            process and deliver the web resources to the client software.<a href="https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/what-is-a-web-client-and-how-it-works-with-web-server-applications/" target="_blank">[6]</a></p>
        <p>Servers can also use other data transfer protocols such as SMTP and FTP. Mail servers use SMTP for transferring
            emails
            from one user to another. Additionally FTP server is used for high speed file transfer operations.<a href="https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/what-is-a-web-client-and-how-it-works-with-web-server-applications/" target="_blank">[6]</a></p>
        <h3>Impact of Web Servers on the Internet?</h3>
        <p>In summary, the web servers are what power the internet. It receives requests for resources from the user's client,
        saves information, and processes data. The server's housed data is essential because the internet wouldn't function
        without it.<a
            href="https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/what-is-a-web-client-and-how-it-works-with-web-server-applications/" target="_blank">[6]</a>
        </p>
        <h3>How Servers and Clients Work Together?</h3>
        <p>When you search for a website, you type its URL in the browser. The browser then translates the web address to its
            IP.
            An IP address is a unique number that identifies devices on the internet. This information is stored on DNS
            nameservers.
            The browser queries the DNS database for the IP address of your URL and retrieves it.<a
                href="https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/what-is-a-web-client-and-how-it-works-with-web-server-applications/" target="_blank">[6]</a></p>
        <p>Once the IP address is found, your web client sends an HTTP request to the server’s IP address. The server receives
            the
            request and sends an HTTP “200 OK” response if everything goes well. Then it sends the requested information or data
            in
            small chunks called packets. Once the packets reach your network, the router forwards them to your device.<a
                href="https://cloudinfrastructureservices.co.uk/what-is-a-web-client-and-how-it-works-with-web-server-applications/" target="_blank">[6]</a></p>

        <h1 id="Establishing">Establishing Communication</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Communication within network environments is crucial for the seamless exchange of data, information, and resources
        across various interconnected devices and systems. Establishing robust communication protocols and frameworks is
        essential to ensure reliability, efficiency, and security in network operations. This report provides a concise overview
        of key considerations and strategies for establishing effective communication in network environments.<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ShaharyarShoukatShou/meetings-in-school-establishing-communication-network-school-management" target="_blank">[7]</a></p>
        <h4>Strategies for Establishing Communication in Network Environments:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>network Design and Architecture: Thoughtful network design and architecture are critical for optimizing communication
                performance and efficiency. Factors such as topology, routing protocols, and bandwidth management should be carefully
                considered to meet the specific requirements of the network environment.<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ShaharyarShoukatShou/meetings-in-school-establishing-communication-network-school-management"
                    target="_blank">[7]</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Quality of Service (QoS): Implementing QoS mechanisms allows network administrators to prioritize traffic based on
                factors such as bandwidth, latency, and packet loss, ensuring optimal performance for critical applications and
                services.<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ShaharyarShoukatShou/meetings-in-school-establishing-communication-network-school-management"
                    target="_blank">[7]</a></p>

        <h3>What is a computer network?</h3>
        <p>Two or more computers connected by wired (cables) or wireless (Wi-Fi) networks are called a computer network because
        they are meant to transfer, exchange, or share resources and data. Hardware (such as switches, routers, access points,
        and cables) and software (such as operating systems or business apps) are used to establish a computer network.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a></p>
        <h3>Computer network types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                LAN (local area network): A LAN connects computers over a relatively short distance, allowing them to share data, files,
                and resources. For example, a LAN may connect all the computers in an office building, school, or hospital. Typically,
                LANs are privately owned and managed.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                WLAN (wireless local area network): A WLAN is just like a LAN but connections between devices on the network are made
                wirelessly.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                the network are made wirelessly.
                WAN (wide area network): As the name implies, a WAN connects computers over a wide area, such as from region to region
                or even continent to continent. The internet is the largest WAN, connecting billions of computers worldwide. You will
                typically see collective or distributed ownership models for WAN management.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                MAN (metropolitan area network): MANs are typically larger than LANs but smaller than WANs. Cities and government
                entities typically own and manage MANs.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some Important terms and concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                IP address: An IP address is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network that uses the Internet
                Protocol for communication. Each IP address identifies the device’s host network and the location of the device on the
                host network. When one device sends data to another, the data includes a ‘header’ that includes the IP address of the
                sending device and the IP address of the destination device.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Routers: A router is a physical or virtual device that sends information contained in data packets between networks.
                Routers analyze data within the packets to determine the best way for the information to reach its ultimate destination.
                Routers forward data packets until they reach their destination node.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Switches: A switch is a device that connects other devices and manages node-to-node communication within a network,
                ensuring data packets reach their ultimate destination. While a router sends information between networks, a switch
                sends information between nodes in a single network. When discussing computer networks, ‘switching’ refers to how data
                is transferred between devices in a network.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How do they work?</h3>
        <p>Computer networks connect nodes like computers, routers, and switches using cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals.
        These connections allow devices in a network to communicate and share information and resources.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/networking" target="_blank">[8]</a></p>
        <hr>
        <h1 id="DNS">DNS</h1>
        <h3>What is DNS?</h3>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain name,
        like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol(IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names
        to IP address so browsers can load Internet resources.<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/what-is-dns/" target="_blank">[9]</a></p>
        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain name,

        to IP address so browsers can load Internet resources.<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/what-is-dns/" target="_blank">[9]</a></p>
        <h3>How does DNS work?</h3>
        <p>DNS resolution is the process of translating a hostname, such www.example.com, into an IP address that is understandable
        by computers, like 192.168.1.1. Every Internet-connected device has an IP address, which is required to identify the
        correct device, much like a street address is needed to identify a certain residence. The text that a user types into
        their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address required to find the example.com webpage must be
        translated when a user wishes to load a webpage.<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/what-is-dns/" target="_blank">[9]</a></p>
        <p>In order to understand the process behind the DNS resolution, it’s important to learn about the different hardware
        components a DNS query must pass between. For the web browser, the DNS lookup occurs "behind the scenes" and requires no
        interaction from the user’s computer apart from the initial request.<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/what-is-dns/" target="_blank">[9]</a></p>
    <hr>
    <h1 id="URL">URL</h1>
    <h3>What is URL?</h3>
    <p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also referred
    to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts including a protocol and domain name that tell a web browser how and
    where to retrieve a resource.<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/URL" target="_blank">[10]</a></p>
    <p>End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browser or by clicking a hyperlink found on a
    webpage, bookmark list, in an email or from another application.<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/URL" target="_blank">[10]</a></p>
